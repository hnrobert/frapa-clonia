## Project Overview

**frapa-clonia** is a cross-platform desktop client for frpc (fast reverse proxy client) built with Avalonia UI. The project is in early initial setup phase.

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Avalonia UI (cross-platform desktop UI framework for .NET)

- **Entry Points** (when implemented):
  - `Program.cs` - Application entry point
  - `App.axaml` - Avalonia application definition

## Project Status

This is a brand new project stub. No source code, build configuration, or dependencies have been set up yet.

## Development Commands

*Not yet implemented* - Build, test, and lint commands will be added when the project structure is established.
